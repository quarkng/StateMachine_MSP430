#State machine library and Logging library
Developed using the EXP-460FR5969 (TI Launchpad board).

C++ was avoided only because some people don't like it.  
But I would have preferred it in object-oriented style.

#### TODO:

* Consider changing the logging library interface to be a bit more similar to [*syslog*](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/syslog.3.html) in Linux.
